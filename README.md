### Hi, I'm Nikhil!

I'm an undergraduate student at [The University of California, Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu). I'm currently working on infrastructure at the Open Computing Facility ([@ocf](https://github.com/ocf)), taping out a low-power navigation chip for robots, and too many [other projects](https://nikhiljha.com/projects/) to count.

Want to talk? hmu.
