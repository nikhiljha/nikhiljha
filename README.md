### Hi, I'm Nikhil!

I'm an undergraduate student at [The University of California, Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu). I'm currently working on Kubernetes things at Berkeley AutoLAB ([@BerkeleyAutomation](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation)) and the Open Computing Facility ([@ocf](https://github.com/ocf)), building [Fedora](https://github.com/nikhiljha/pp-fedora-sdsetup) for [phones](https://github.com/nikhiljha/awesome-linux-mobile), and too many [other projects](https://nikhiljha.com/projects/) to count.

Want to talk? hmu.
